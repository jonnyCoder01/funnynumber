            <b>Please read these Terms of Use carefully before using Funny Numbers Game</b>
			<p>By using the Service on any computer, mobile phone, tablet or another device collectively the (“Device”), you as a user of the Service confirm that you have read, understand and agree to be bound by these Terms of Use and any other applicable law. Funny Numbers Game Developer (“We”, “Us”, “Our”) may change these Terms of Use at any time without notice, effective upon its posting on the App. Your continued use of the Service shall be considered your acceptance of the revised Terms of Use. If you do not agree to these Terms of Use, please do not use this Service.</p></br>
            <h2>1. Scope of License</h2>
            <p>Subject to these Terms of Use, we grant you non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable limited license to use the Service solely for your personal, non-commercial purposes. This license does not allow you to use the Service on any Device that you do not own or rightfully control, and you may not distribute or make the Service available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, redistribute or sublicense the Service. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license or terms of the relevant certified application store, from which you have downloaded the App), decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify or create derivative works of the Website or the App, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law). Any attempt to do so is a violation of our rights as a licensor. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.</p></br>
			<h2>2. Intellectual Property</h2>
			<p>All intellectual property on the Service, which includes materials protected by copyright, trademark, or patent laws, is proprietary either to us or to third parties. All trademarks, service marks and trade names are owned, registered and/or licensed by us. All content offered by the Service (except for personal information), including but not limited to text, software, scripts, code, designs, graphics, photos, sounds, music, videos, applications, interactive features and all other content (the “Content”) is our intellectual property; all rights reserved.</p></br>
			<h2>3. Privacy</h2>
			<p>Any and all issues regarding the provision of your personal information are governed by our Privacy Policy and you are giving your consent to the collection of such information by using the Service; therefore, we recommend you, and you should ensure that you have read the Privacy Policy carefully.</p></br>
			<h2>4. Fees and Payments</h2>
			<p>The App is free to download. However, certain features of the Service are offered on a subscription basis for a fee. You will pay the application store from which you have downloaded the App (the “Application Store”) the applicable fees (and any related taxes) as they become due.</p>
			<p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable laws, we may change subscription fees at any time. We will give you a reasonable notice of any such pricing changes by posting the new prices on or through the App and/or by sending you an email notification. If you do not wish to pay the new fees, you can cancel the applicable subscription prior to the change going into effect.</p>
			<p>You authorize the Application Store to charge the applicable fees to the payment card that you submit.</p>
			<p>By signing up for certain subscriptions, you agree that your subscription may be automatically renewed. Unless you cancel your subscription, you authorize the Application Store to charge you for the renewal term. The period of auto-renewal will be the same as your initial subscription period unless otherwise disclosed to you on the Service. The renewal rate will be no more than the rate for the immediately prior subscription period, excluding any promotional and discount pricing, unless we notify you of a rate change prior to your auto-renewal. You must cancel your subscription in accordance with the cancellation procedures disclosed to you for the particular subscription. We will not refund fees that may have accrued to your account and will not prorate fees for a cancelled subscription.</p>
			<p>We may offer a free trial subscription for the Service. Free trial (if any) provides you with access to the Service for a period of time, with details specified when you sign up for the offer. Unless you cancel before the end of the free trial, or unless otherwise stated, your access to the Service will automatically continue and you will be billed the applicable fees for the Service. We may send you a reminder when your free trial is about to end, but we do not guarantee any such notifications. It is ultimately your responsibility to know when the free trial will end. We reserve the right, in our absolute discretion, to modify or terminate any free trial offer, your access to the Service during the free trial, or any of these terms without notice and with no liability. We reserve the right to limit your ability to take advantage of multiple free trials.</p>
			<p>The Service and your rights to use it expire at the end of the paid period of your subscription. If you do not pay the fees or charges due, we may make reasonable efforts to notify you and resolve the issue; however, we reserve the right to disable or terminate your access to the Service (and may do so without notice).</p>
			<p>Subscriptions purchased via an Application Store are subject to such Application Store's refund policies. This means we cannot grant refunds. You will have to contact Application Store support.</p></br>
